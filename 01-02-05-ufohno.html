        	<h4>Editor’s Corner</h4>
           	
		<p class="pclass1">Wotcha Chums,</p>
 		<p class="pclass1">Wow, that sure was a lot of far-fetched ideas! A museum uniform that can be adapted to suit different body types? A museum director talking to the public in a front of house capacity? A museum targeting audiences regardless of their gift shop spending power? Just one more of these wild concepts could have shattered your sense of disbelief and the comic would have been ruined!</p>
  		<p class="pclass1">Sure is a sign of our times that getting a job that sticks so close to the minimum wage counts as a happy ending, huh readers? Some of you may be disheartened that Betty and Zeeta wound up working for the museum rather than tearing it down. Don’t worry, they started a union aiming to both improve staff conditions and return the museum collection to common, public ownership!</p>
           	<p class="pclass1">This editorial was originally written as a way of passing information to co-workers knowing that none of the managers would even finish the comic. That situation has advanced since then, so let’s cut to the bit about flying saucers!</p>

            	<p class="pclass1">The Galactic Spacecraft Museum’s entrance lobby is stuffed full of flying saucers. Let’s find out a little more about these ships and the humans who close-encountered them!</p>

            	<p class="pclass1"><b>Spaceship 1:</b>	A mothership caught on camera by George Adamski in 1947. Adamski, founder of the Royal Order of Tibet, was previously granted license during Prohibition to make wine for religious purposes. Adamski claimed he “made enough wine for all of Southern California”. This community spirit is testament to Adamski’s character, rendering the authenticity of his photographs beyond dispute.</p>

		<p class="pclass1"><b>Spaceship 2:</b> After missing a bus in 1949, Daniel Fry went for a walk and encountered this ship. Pilot Alan (pronounced the alien way; A-Lawn) invited Fry on board and gave him a crash course on Theosophical meta-physics. Fry later failed a polygraph test while recounting these events, proving once and for all that lie-detectors should never be used as evidence in a court of law.</p>

       	<section>

		<p class="pclass1"><b>Spaceship 3:</b> Another Adamski ship, this one from 1952. While the idea that aliens built the Pyramids or Moai is obviously racist nonsense, these photos prove that extra-terrestrials were responsible for the invention of surgical lamps, pressurised-gas lanterns, and 100-watt General Electric light bulbs.</p>

		<p class="pclass1"><b>Spaceship 4:</b>The Trent family snapped shots of this unidentifiable object hovering over their farm in 1950. Framed by the vertical ‘go-faster’ lines of power cables to infuse movement into a static medium, these photos beautifully highlight the Trent family’s flare for composition.</p>

      	<section> 
		
		<p class="pclass1"><b>Spaceship 5:</b> A ‘not-to-scale’ saucer found on Silpho Moor near Scarborough in 1957. The original was 18 inches wide and covered in unusual hieroglyphics. Knowing how these encounters go, the writings were probably warning humanity against use of atomic weapons. Aliens are something of a broken record in that regard. The saucer was sliced into tiny pieces so various people could study them. This probably won’t help with deciphering the message, surely dooming us all to nuclear annihilation.</p>

       	<section> 
		
		<p class="pclass1"><b>Spaceship 6:</b> This craft was spotted from a bedroom window in the Midlands town of Smethwick. The incident was scrupulously recorded by a witness, who deposited the cutest little sketch with the Ministry of Defence. The Galactic Spacecraft Museum salutes the skills of this impromptu records-creator!</p>

    	<section> 
		
		<p class="pclass1"><b>Spaceship 7:</b> Brazilian Air Force Captain Viegas was on the deck of a ship near Trindade Island when he saw this U.F.O. in 1958. The U.S. Air Force U.F.O. investigation Project Blue Book deemed the photo a hoax, asking “If Viegas was such a great air force captain, how come he was on a boat?” In order to avoid two militant and fascistic nations going to war, it’s perhaps best if everyone just agrees to disagree.</p> 
		
	</section>
                 
   	<section>  
		
		<p class="pclass1"><b>Spaceship 8:</b> Kenneth Arnold’s 1947 sightings of unidentified, flying, saucer-like objects are often cited as the start of modern U.F.O. lore. The U.S. Air Force investigated and decided these were definitely not “space ships”, "new-type army rockets", or "secret bacteriological weapons designed by some foreign power". That last denial seems oddly specific; it’s probably best for our peace of mind if we don’t think too hard about that.</p>
		
	</section>
            
       	<section>  
		
		<p class="pclass1"><b>Spaceship 9:</b> The Kecksburg Acorn is a name given to the fireball that fell from the sky over Pennsylvania in 1965. NASA analysis of burnt up fragments suggests the Kecksburg Acorn was in fact a crashed Soviet satellite. The Kecksburg Acorn was included in this collection regardless, as the curator responsible thought ‘Kecksburg Acorn’ sounded like a humorous name for a little nugget of poop. More curatorial decisions are made this way than you might at first think.</p>

       	<section> 
		
		<p class="pclass1"><b>And the rest...</b></p>
           
           	<p class="pclass1">The Galactic Spacecraft Museum was using a spacecraft spotted several times in Belgium between 1989 and 1990. The museum logo and spacecraft uniform match those witnessed by Antônio Villas Boas when he was abducted in 1957. By the time of our story they had removed this branding, so as to avoid instantly incriminating themselves.</p>
