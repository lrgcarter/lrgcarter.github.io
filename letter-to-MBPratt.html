		<p>Hi Minnie,</p>
		
		<p>I recently read Stone Butch Blues, and it meant a lot to me. I want to put it in front of everyone I know and say "Hey! Read This! This Is Amazing!" I also want to do something to repay Leslie for hir free book.</p>
		
		<p>A lot of my friends use e-readers for their reading and find that PDFs aren't always displayed at their best in this format. This made me think that a way I could repay Leslie was to help get hir book out there in other formats. I decided I would create various file types and send them to you, in the hope that they could be added to the website.</p>
		
		<p>So, what I did was as follows:</p>
		
		<p>- Got the Stone Butch Blues PDF, ran an Optical Character Recognition programme on it, and saved it as a word document.</p>
		
		<p>- Went through and corrected all the places where the OCR had got confused by the italics, mucked up the formatting, etc.</p>
		
		<p>- Put the word document through the Calibre E-book Management programme to convert it into other formats.</p>
		
		<p>- Made this web-page as a way of linking you to the files. Once you have received them, I will take this page down. </p>

		<p>Hopefully this is all within the spirit of Leslie's requests at the back of the 20th anniversary edition. If not, I apologise, and will remove the files at once!  </p>
		
		<p>I present the files in the following formats:</p>
		
		<p><a href="StoneButchBlues20thAnniversaryAuthorEdition-LeslieFeinberg.docx" target="_blank">DOCX</a> (this is just so you can see what I did with the PDF to make the others)</p>
		
		<p><a href="StoneButchBlues20thAnniversaryAuthorEdition-LeslieFeinberg.epub" target="_blank">EPUB</a></p>

		<p><a href="StoneButchBlues20thAnniversaryAuthorEdition-LeslieFeinberg.mobi" target="_blank">MOBI</a></p>
		
		<p><a href="StoneButchBlues20thAnniversaryAuthorEdition-LeslieFeinberg.azw3" target="_blank">AZW3</a></p>

		<p><a href="StoneButchBlues20thAnniversaryAuthorEdition-LeslieFeinberg.txt" target="_blank">TXT</a></p>
		
		<p>I can't promise I caught all the mistakes caused by turning the PDF into a word doc, but I did my best. Also, I have found that the e-reader programme doesn't seem to fix the meta-data to the files. So while at my end I have tagged the book with the tags provided within, I'm not sure they'll still be there at your end. </p>

		<p>I hope in doing all this I was not too impulsive or in other ways out of line. Please feel free to message me on twitter with any response.</p>
		
		<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
		
		<p>Louis Carter</p>
