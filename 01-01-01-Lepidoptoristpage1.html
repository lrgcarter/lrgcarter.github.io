                      Panel 1.
                      The hold of a military transport aircraft. The troops are wearing wingsuits. The go-light is red.
                      Captions: My name is Li Jing. I hunt butterflies.
                      Panel 2.
                      The go-light goes green. The troops start jumping from the aircraft.
                      Captions: I know what you’re thinking. “From a plane?”
                      Panel 3.
                      The light turns red again. The troops have left the aircraft to begin their mission.
                      Captions: “What are they -- giant, genetically engineered, monster butterflies?” To which I reply… 
                      Panel 4.
                      The troops soar over the clouds towards a swarm of giant, genetically engineered, monster butterflies.
                      Captions: Yeah, pretty much. You see, America owes a lot of countries a lot of money, mine included. And someone told their president that thing about butterfly wings causing storms in China.
                      Panel 5.
                      Some of the troops die as legs/antenna/proboscis lash out. Li Jing weaves between these towards one of the butterflies. 
                      Captions: So they said, “why stop there?” “Why not make butterflies that tear the very fabric of space-time?”
                      Panel 6.
                      Li Jing stands atop the head of the butterfly, her electro-scalpel held high.
                      Captions: On the plus side, our cities no longer have that whole smog problem... But only because it’s been sucked though the hole that is now our sky.
